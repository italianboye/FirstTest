      <p>
        Packing peanuts, also known as foam peanuts or packing noodles, <br />
        are small, foam pieces used to fill empty spaces in shipping boxes
        <br />
        to protect fragile items during transit. Their history dates back to the
        mid-20th century.

      <p>
        Packing peanuts were first introduced in the 1960s as an
        alternative to traditional packing materials like newspaper and straw.
        <br />
        They were made from polystyrene foam, which provided excellent
        cushioning properties while being lightweight.
